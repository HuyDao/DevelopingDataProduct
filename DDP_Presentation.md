Why an Investment Calculator?
========================================================


It is always a challenge to decide what to do with your retirement money. Before investing though, you should have at least a basic idea of what would happen in different market scenarios.


The application aims to give everyone a simple view of their choices based on the market levers: inflation, bank rates and financial investments returns, as an incentive to actually go and discuss their choices with a professional.
