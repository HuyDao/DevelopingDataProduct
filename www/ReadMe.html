<p> Inputs:</p>
<p><b>Investment Sum</b> = sum of money you plan to invest.</p>
<p><b>Years</b> = number of years you plan to keep that sum invested.</p>
<p><b>Inflation</b> = percentage on inflation per year, in a slider form. The value is used to calculate the decrease of value per year.</p>
<p><b>Bank Rate</b> = percentage on bank interest per year, in a slider form. The value is used to calculate the added value due to bank interest per year.</p>
<p><b>Investment Rate</b> = percentage on investment return per year, in a slider form. The value is used to calculate the added value due to financial investment gains / losses per year.</p>

<p>Outputs:</p>
<p><b>Value of sum</b> = What sum of money you need at the end of the investment period to be on par with the value of money you plan to invest today.</p>
<p><b>Cash Yield</b> = Value of today's money at the end of the investment period, if you keep the cash and do nothing with that money. It is caculated by reducing the amount of inflation every year.</p>
